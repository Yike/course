    "### Main Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ***Python*** programming language is accessible to novice programmers seeking to develop software engineering skills, and powerful enough for serious computation. *Python* is used by computer programmers and scientists alike. Thus, it provides the tools used in software engineering as well as numerous libraries for scientific computing. In addition, *Python* is an open source project easily linked with other languages such as *Fortran* and *C*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***Ubuntu*** is a Linux-based operating system. It is based on the principle of open-source development and users are encouraged to use free software, study how it works, improve upon it, and distribute it. Using *Ubuntu* serves as a preparation for the use of high performance computing clusters, who mostly rely on Linux-based operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***Microsoft Azure*** is a cloud computing platform which provides the power and scalability required for collaboration, high performance computation, and data-intensive processing. Class participants receive access to the cloud using *Microsoft Azure Academic Passes* for six months.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Website: http://research.microsoft.com/azure\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ***structToolbox*** is a computer program for the simulation and estimation of a dynamic model of female labor supply decisions (Keane et al., 2011). It is designed as a teaching tool to show how, by acquiring software engineering skills, structural econometricians can more readily absorb research from computational science, improve the transparency of implementations, and ensure recomputability of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Website: http://policy-lab.org/structToolbox\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ***Quantitiative Economics*** website provides a series of lectures on quantitative economic modelling using *Python*. Topics include economic theory and empirics, mathematical and statistical concepts related to quantitative economics, algorithms and numerical methods for studying economic problems, and coding skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Website: http://quant-econ.net\n",
    "\n",
    "### Group Project\n",
    "\n",
    "* The group projects consist of a contribution to the ***Quantitiative Economics*** project, an open source library for quantitative economic modeling. Each group prepares a high-quality implementation of a quantitative economic model of their choice. We will build on existing material provided as code supplements to several economic textbooks (see course website for selected references). As the course moves along, we use our newly acquired skills to iteratively improve our workflow and the quality of our implementations. Groups report on their progress and receive feedback in a series of presentations throughout the semester.\n",

    "    \n",
    "* Numerical Methods for Economists\n",
    "    * The objective of this course is to introduce graduate students to computational approaches for solving economic models. We will formulate economic problems in computationally tractable form and use techniques from numerical analysis to solve them.
